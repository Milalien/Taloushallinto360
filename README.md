# Taloushallinto 360

A static website developed as a part of a project for LAB University of Applied Sciences.
Project name: "Taloushallinnon taituri: modulaarinen kokonaisharjoitus"

The site features four case companies, that each have their own background stories and excercises for Financial Management students to complete. The purpose is to bring the orientations of their studies together to make their connections more clear.

The website is a basic HTML+CSS+JavaScript page, and most of the texts are in the "config.json" file for easier updating without a database. This was a demand for the project, since it will be linked to Moodle courses for easy access.

The front page and the "tietoa" page have an animation on the background, that was made with JavaScript and CSS.

The overall look was designed by a web designer student, and the code made by me and a classmate.
He implemented the animations and some of the pages, I wrote  most of the CSS side and did the JSON text fetching.
